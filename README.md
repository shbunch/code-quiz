# Code Quiz

## Description

This project involves creating a timed quiz from scratch that incorpates JavaScript.

While I was unable to complete this fully, this assignment helped me understand multiple concepts such as:

-Using event listeners<br>
-Using JavaScript to dynamically create and edit other variables and properties within my code<br>
-Using methods to grab nested content<br>
-Creating timers that start and change based on other events<br>
